# Progress Report: Building userver Framework

## Current Status

I've been working on building the userver framework and have made the following progress:

1. **Build Dependencies Installed**: Successfully installed all required build dependencies for Debian 11 using the official dependency list from the userver documentation.

2. **Packages Installed**:
   - Core build tools (cmake, ninja-build, gcc, etc.)
   - Required libraries (libboost, libfmt, libyaml-cpp, etc.)
   - Database dependencies (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, etc.)
   - Development tools (clang, llvm, protobuf, etc.)

3. **Framework Build Completed**: 
   - Created build_debug directory
   - Ran CMake configuration which completed successfully
   - Successfully built the entire framework including core components and dynamic config files

4. **Issues Resolved**:
   - Generated missing dynamic config header files using the chaotic-gen tools
   - The build system now correctly finds all generated files
   - Completed the build of all framework components without errors

## Current Environment

- Debian 11 (Bullseye) system
- All required build dependencies installed
- CMake 3.18.4 available
- Build directory exists at `build_debug/`
- Framework successfully built
