# Product Context

## Problem Statement

Traditional C++ server development faces several challenges:

1. **Complexity of Asynchronous Programming**: Writing efficient asynchronous code requires deep understanding of threading, synchronization, and non-blocking I/O patterns.

2. **Context Switching Overhead**: Traditional threaded approaches suffer from significant overhead due to OS context switches, especially under high load.

3. **Resource Utilization**: Inefficient use of CPU and memory resources due to blocking operations and thread management overhead.

4. **Integration Complexity**: Integrating with multiple databases, messaging systems, and external services requires significant boilerplate code.

5. **Configuration Management**: Dynamically changing service configurations without restarts is challenging in traditional C++ applications.

6. **Monitoring and Observability**: Implementing comprehensive logging, tracing, and metrics collection is time-consuming.
