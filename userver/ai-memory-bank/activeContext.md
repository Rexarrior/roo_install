## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Framework Adoption
- Userver framework provides comprehensive solution for high-performance C++ microservices
- Component-based architecture simplifies service composition
- Coroutine-based async model provides excellent performance characteristics
- Rich ecosystem of database and protocol integrations reduces development time

### Implementation Considerations
- Learning curve for coroutine-based programming model
- Need to understand component lifecycle and configuration
- Importance of following framework patterns for optimal performance
- Integration requirements with existing systems and databases

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- Component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Configuration-driven behavior through YAML files
- Handler-based request processing with middleware support
- Modular design with dependency injection

### Performance Optimization
- Minimize context switches through async operations
- Use connection pooling for database and HTTP clients
- Implement proper deadline propagation
- Leverage caching for frequently accessed data

### Development Practices
- Follow component lifecycle guidelines
- Use framework-provided synchronization primitives
- Implement structured logging with contextual information
- Provide comprehensive metrics and tracing
- Write tests at multiple levels (unit, functional, integration)

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Key Insights
1. Userver framework abstracts away complexity of asynchronous programming
